Hello! I am a junior web developer looking to get into the industry and I have a passion for coding. This is my repository for my Code Kentucky project and my first ever website. This website is space themed and highlights a lot of my coding skills that I am familiar with. In this website you will be able to look at the different planets in our solar system (and Pluto is no longer a planet sadly!), getting a look at the newly released James Webb Space Telescope photos, as well as a contact us form.

     CSS FEATURES:
     ⚫ Hamburger icon is included for all pages when the width is set to 770 pixels or less.
     ⚫ On the planets tab, I used the flex wrap feature to have the planets adjust accordinglgy to the page size.
     ⚫ When shrinmking the James Webb Space Telescope page down to 1000 pixels or less the text will shrink and once it reaches 767 pixels or less, The text box will move to the bottom of the screen with even smaller text.
     ⚫ When shrinking the 'Contact Us' page down to 880 pixels or less, the picture on the page will go on top of the contact us form, giving it a cleaner look for mobile users.
     ⚫ I used nth child on my 'JWST' page to get the transition working properly for my slide animations.

     JAVASCRIPT FEATURES:
     ⚫ I created a contact us form with different forms of validation. The form will verify that you email is in the correct format and will display your name back to you if the form is submitted correctly.

Special Instructions: When clicking on the 'JWST' page, allow it a few seconds for the animation to start and enjoy the slides.

Thanks for checking out my GitHub! I hope you enjoy the website as much as I did creating it.
