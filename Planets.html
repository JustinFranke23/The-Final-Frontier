                <h2>Mercury</h2>
                <p>This planet holds the title of being the smallest planet in our solar system, as well as being the closest to the sun! Because the planet is composed mainly of iron ore and rock, it has a high density.</p>

                <p>This planet is the second closest to our sun and a neighbor planet to Earth. Venus is the hottest planet in our solar system due to a consitently hot atmosphere. The atmosphere is mainly composed of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and sulfuric acid clouds.</p>

                <p>This is our home! You are currently located somewhere on this blue rock and all of our ancestors and our future generations will reside here (until we migrate to another planet that is). Our planets surface is composed of 70% water, as well as our air being made up by mainly nitrogen and oxygen.</p>

                <p>Another neighbor of Earth, Mars is the fourth farthest planet from our sun. Like our planet, Mars has a variety mountains and volcanoes. Due to iron oxide on the surface, it gives the planet a brownish red tinge. In the not so distant future we have plans to land humans on Mars!</p>

            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <p>Jupiter is by far the biggest planet located in our solar system and is the 5th farthest away from the sun. Jupiter is a giant gas planet with a atmosphere of mostly helium and hydrogen. The great red spot that can be visually seen on Jupiter is a gigantic storm that spans about 10,000 miles wide.</p>

            <h2>Saturn</h2>
            <p>Saturn the sixth planet furthest from our sun, visually stands out amongst other planets in our solar system due to its massive rings. Another unique trait this gas giant has is that it has 82 moons, making it the planet with the most moons in our solar system.</p>

            <h2>Uranus</h2>
            <p>Uranus is an ice giant planet, that also happens to be the coldest planet in the solar system! The temperature of Uranus is around minus 320 degrees fahrenheit (brrrrgh!). The planet also has rings although they are very subtle. The atmosphere is mainly made up of methane which gives it a blue tinge.</p>

            <h2>Neptune</h2>
            <p>Neptune is the 8th and furthest planet from the sun. It is quite similar to Uranus as it is a ice giant, as well as having some subtle rings. This planet has the fastest wind speeds of any planet in our solar system, with speeds reaching 1,118 MPH. </p>
